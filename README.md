## Description

This repository contains Python notebooks that accompany the review entitled _A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists_. A version of the review can be downloaded from the arxiv at [arXiv:1803.08823.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823)

## Datasets
>Most of the examples in the notebooks use the three datasets described below. Details on the datasets can be found in the Appendix of the review.

* MNIST. [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a dataset of of handwritten numerical characters. The dataset consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples
* SUSY datset The [SUSY dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY) consists of Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric collision events. More informaton about the dataset can be found in the accompanying [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5308).
* Nearest Neighbor Ising Model. This dataset consists of samples generated from the two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupled Ising model at a range of temperatures above and below the critical point. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/ML-Review-Datasets/isingMC/). More information about the dataset can be found in the appendix of the accompanying review.
